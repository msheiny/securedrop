  # Since the top-level playbook (e.g. securedrop-prod.yml)
  # sets `sudo: true`, the sudo parameter must be explicitly
  # overridden on a per-task basis. If sudo remains true
  # for this task, Ansible will prompt for the sudo password
  # of the host machine (i.e. the machine running the playbook)
  # in order to proceed. This would be annoying and is
  # completely unnecessary for a simple wait action.
