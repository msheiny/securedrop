# Selenium 3 makes breaking changes with the 2.X API, and requires the
# installation of the Mozilla geckodriver. Since the Aaron Swartz Day Hackathon
# is approaching, which will involve many new external contributors, we've
# decided to play it as safe as possible by downgrading Firefox to the latest
# version (46.0.1) that is compatible with the last 2.X series Selenium release
# (2.53.6). After the Hackathon, we'll resolve the geckodriver business and
# remove the following three tasks (as well as add firefox back to the
# `test_apt_dependencies` list).
